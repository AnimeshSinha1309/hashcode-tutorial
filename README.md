# HashCode Tutorial

## What this is

This is a codebase to test out some routine ideas in solving optimization 
problems, and the boilerplate code needed for the same.

## Results

* a_example: 2 (Manual)
* b_lovely_landscapes: 212679 (Graph DFS)
* c_memorable_moments: 1533 (Online Greedy)
* d_pet_pictures: 362167 (Greedy Graph)
* e_shiny_selfies: 317730 (Online Greedy)

Final Score = 894111

## So what rank would I get?

Effective World Rank: *363*

Rank in purely Indian teams: *10*
